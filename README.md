# Recurrent neural network: Character-level language model

We build a recurrent neural network (RNN) that can generate text at the character level. We use it to generate new names for dinosaurs.

# Dataset
Your assistant has collected a list of all the dinosaur names they could find, and compiled them into this dataset. To create new dinosaur names, you will build a character-level language model to generate new names. Your algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names
